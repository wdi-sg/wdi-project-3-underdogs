# **User Story**

For my WDI Project 2 I wanted to create and deploy a website that demystifies, and simplifies, the art of cooking! Some of the world's most famous chefs serve dishes in their flagship restaurants that are often very simple and often the most popular items on their menus. With just a few ingredients and a little effort, these dishes can be prepared in less than 30 minutes!

# **The Site**
[KYURETA](https://dry-citadel-50559.herokuapp.com)

Pick something that you like and try making it! Better yet, share some recipes from your favorite chefs from around the world!

Finding recipes is as easy as searching [Google](https://www.google.com) for recipes from your favorite chef. Most chefs have websites listing a few of their favorite recipes. Don't know any chefs by name? Check out the following resources online:

[World's 50 Best Restaurants](http://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50-winners): great resource to see the chef's behind some of the world's best restaurants.

[World's Most Decorated Michelin Star Chefs](https://trulyexperiences.com/blog/2015/03/decorated-michelin-star-chefs-still-business/): guide to the most awarded chefs around the world.

[Singapore's Most Interesting Chefs & Restaurants](http://sethlui.com/best-restaurants-singapore-where-chefs-eat/): check out the best of the Singapore food scene!

## **Design and Functionality**
1. Users must register and login with a username and password.
2. Users can view existing chefs and recipes that any other user has added to the site. They can add new chefs and recipes and also add recipes to chefs that other users have added.
3. Users can edit or delete chefs and recipes they've created however they cannot edit or delete entries other users have created.
